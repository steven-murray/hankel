Examples
========

To help get you started using ``hankel``, we've compiled a few extended examples.
Other simple examples can be found in the API documentation for each object, by looking at some of the tests, or
by looking at whatever is in the ``devel/`` directory at the time.

*So, what would you like to learn?*
